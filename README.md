# Gibsonify

Gibsonify is a Flutter app designed to follow [Gibson's 24-hour methodology](https://www.gov.uk/research-for-development-outputs/an-interactive-24-hour-recall-for-assessing-the-adequacy-of-iron-and-zinc-intakes-in-developing-countries) for nutritional data collection.

_TODO Add demo gif_

## Description

The app follows the structure of the four passes of Gibson's methodology. It has been designed with prompts to help the enumerator carrying out the survey to make the process as intuitive as possible. Having been designed with offline usage in mind, it uses a local database of the recipes and recent data collected.

## Installation

_TODO Add installation instructions_

<!--
Probably direct (PGP-signed) apk download from GitHub releases (and tags?), then maybe Google Play Store & F-droid links?
-->

## Development

Instructions for developing Gibsonify are in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
